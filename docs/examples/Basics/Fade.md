# Fade

Fades the red light (led) between off and on continually.


### Load the Fade sketch
- File -> Examples -> Denbit -> Basics -> Fade
- Compile the software: click the tick in the top left of the Arduino application... wait while it compiles...
- Upload the software: click the arrow in the top left of the Arduino application... wait while it uploads

### Why?
This demonstrates that even though the micocontoller can only output ones and zeros it can fool some things into thinking that it is outputting voltage levels between the high level (3.3 volts) and the low level (0 volts). 

The process is called PWD, Pulsed Width Modulation.
