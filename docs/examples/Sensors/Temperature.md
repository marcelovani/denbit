# Temperature

This example moves a servo back & forth. 

Connect the parts as shown in the image:
- GND to one end of a 10K resistor(Brown - Black - Orange - Gold)
- One leg of the thermistor (temperature sensor) to the other end of the resistor
- 3V3 to the other leg of the thermistor
- A0 to the point where the thermistor & resitor are connected

  (GND) ---- (10k-Resistor) ------- (Analog Pin A0) ------- (Thermistor) ---- (3V3)
