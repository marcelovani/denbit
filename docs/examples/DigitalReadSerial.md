# DigitalReadSerial

This example shows you how to monitor the state of the left switch by establishing serial communication 
between your Denbit and your computer over USB. 


### Load the DigitalReadSerial sketch
- File -> Examples -> Denbit -> Basics -> DigitalReadSerial
- Compile the software: click the tick in the top left of the Arduino application... wait while it compiles...
- Upload the software: click the arrow in the top left of the Arduino application... wait while it uploads

### Why?
This demonstrates a basic way to communicate to other systems. Handy for many things like:
- Debugging
- Graphing
- Sending commands
- etc
