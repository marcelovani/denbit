# Denbit

This example shows you how to monitor the state of the left switch by establishing serial communication 
between your Denbit and your computer over USB. 


### Load the Denbit sketch
- File -> Examples -> Denbit -> Basics -> Denbit
- Compile the software: click the tick in the top left of the Arduino application... wait while it compiles...
- Upload the software: click the arrow in the top left of the Arduino application... wait while it uploads

All the lights will flash. Pushing a button will stop one of the lights flashing, simply showing the Denbit is working.

### Why?
Let the library handle setting up the Denbit so you don't have to.

To see exactly what it does have a look at [/src/Denbit.cpp](https://github.com/theapi/denbit/blob/master/src/Denbit.cpp)
